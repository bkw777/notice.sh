# notice.sh

Desktop notification client using only bash and gdbus.

This is [bkw777/notice.sh](https://github.com/bkw777/notice.sh)  
Originally a rewrite of [vlevit/notify-send.sh](https://github.com/vlevit/notify-send.sh)

Differences:
* Refactored to remove all the unnecessary external tools (dc, bc, sed)
* Remove unnecessary here-docs (they create temp files behind the scenes)
* Remove unnecessary subshells
* General optimizing and tightening
* Fix background process management for actions
* Remove redundant commandline options
* Combine notify-send.sh and notify-action.sh into single notice.sh

Requires `bash` and `gdbus` (part of glib2).

If you need commandline compatibility with `notify-send` of [libnotify](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libnotify), or with vlevit/notify-send.sh,
try `notify-send.sh`: it's a wrapper around `notice.sh` to translate the different commandline options. It supports all respective options.

## Install
```
$ sudo apt install bash libglib2.0-bin
$ sudo make install
```
It's also a single self-contained script that can be run from anywhere without necessarily "installing".  
For example, [bkw777/mainline](https://github.com/bkw777/mainline) includes it and runs it out of a lib dir.

Options:
  -N, --app-name=APP_NAME           Formal name of the application sending the notification
                                    --app-name="Super De-Duper"

                                      https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html
                                    --icon=/path/to/file.svg   - or png, jpg, etc

  -s, --summary=SUMMARY             Title message
                                    If both this and trailing non-option args are supplied,
                                    this takes precedence and the trailing args are ignored.

  -b, --body=BODY                   Message body                        (note)

  -h, --hint=NAME:VALUE[:TYPE]      Extra data

                                    --hint=urgency:0                    (note)
                                    --hint=category:mail                (note)

                                    --hint=desktop-entry:firefox
                                    --hint=image-path:/path/to/file.png|jpg|svg|...

                                    TYPE is the data type like string or boolean
                                    and can usually be omitted.

  -a, --action=[[LABEL]:]COMMAND    Action
                                    Can be given multiple times.
                                    LABEL is a label for a button.
                                    COMMAND is a shell command to run when action is invoked.

               LABEL:COMMAND        button-action
                                    COMMAND is run if the LABEL button is pressed

               :COMMAND             default-action                      (note)
                                    COMMAND is run if the notification is clicked

               COMMAND              close-action
                                    COMMAND is run when the notification closes (whether clicked or expired)
                                    Use in combination with -t0 (never self-expire) to get a behavior
                                    similar to default-action on servers that don't support default-action.

  -i, --id=ID                       ID of an existing notification to update or close
  -i, --id=@FILENAME                write ID to & read ID from FILENAME
                                    If --id is not used, then ID is printed to stdout.

  -t, --ttl=SECONDS                 Time-To-Live, in seconds, before the notification closes itself
                                    0 = forever

  -f, --force-close                 Actively close the notification after TTL seconds,
                                    or after processing any of it's actions

  -c, --close                       Close notification - requires --id

  -v, --version                     Display script version

  -?, --help                        This help

  --                                End option parsing
                                    Anything after this is treated as literal SUMMARY text,
                                    even if it looks like an option.

Reference: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/notification-spec-latest.html

(note) Not all servers support all features. Some options may do nothing on your server.
```

There is also a `-%` option for internal use to launch the background process to watch dbus for the button presses and run the commands specified by `--action`

As a convenience, any trailing non-option arguments are an alternative way to supply the summary instead of `--summary`  
This allows to send simple notifications by just: `notice this is a message`  
If both `--summary` and trailing args are supplied, `--summary` is used and the trailing args are ignored.

`--` ends option parsing, which can be used to prevent text that looks like options from being interpreted as more options.  
Example: `notice -n dialog-information --this causes an unrecognized option error--`  
while, `notice -n dialog-information -- --this does not cause an unrecognized option error--`  

All options are optional. You can actually give no options at all and it produces an empty notification.

Reference: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/notification-spec-latest.html

So, for example, to notify a user of a new email:
```
$ notice --icon=mail-unread --app-name=mail --hint=sound-name:message-new-email --summary="The Subject" --body="Some body text"
```
(not all notification servers support sounds, so you may not hear any sound)

To update or close an existing notification, you need to know its ID.  
To know the ID you can collect it from stdout when it's created
```
$ notice --ttl=0 Initial Message
37
```

Update this notification using `--id`
```
$ notice --ttl=0 --id=37 Updated Message
```

Close this notification
```
$ notice --id=37 --close
```

Or, `--id=@filename` automates that  
As long as you give it the same filename each time:  
The first time, the file will be created and the new ID written to it.  
On update, the ID will be read from the file.  
On close, the ID will be read from the file and the file will be deleted.
```
$ f=/tmp/notifcation_id.$$ \
  ;notice -t0 -i @$f Initial Message \
  ;sleep 2 \
  ;notice -t0 -i @$f Updated Message \
  ;sleep 2 \
  ;notice -c -i @$f
```

Example, increase volume by 5% and show the new level,  
updating the same notification rather than generating new ones  
(set the volume low, paste the command & enter, then up-arrow to repeat the command a few times)
```
$ notice -i @/tmp/volume_notification -n sound -s "Sound Volume" -b "$(amixer sset Master 5%+ |awk '/[0-9]+%/ {print $2,$5}')"
```

To add buttons to the notification, use one or more `--action=label:command`
```
$ notice -t0 -a "white xterm:xterm -bg white -fg black" -a "black xterm:xterm -bg black -fg white" action buttons
```

To specify a "default-action", use `--action=:command`  
Action is invoked if the user clicks on the notification but not on any button.  
Not all servers support "default-action", so this option may do nothing.

To specify a "close-action", use `--action=command`  
Action is invoked when the notification closes, if not already closed by some other action.  
Similar to default-action, in that if the user clicks on a notification, that closes it, and so would trigger the close-action.  
But close-action is also invoked if the notification closes itself from timimg out, and is not invoked if the notification closes as part of some other button-action or default-action.  
Use with `-t0` to get a behavior similar default-action when the notification server doesn't support default actions.
```
$ notice \
  -n dialog-information \
  -t 5 \
  -a "Button 0:notice Button 0 invoked" \
  -a "Button 1:notice Button 1 invoked" \
  -a ":notice default-action invoked" \
  -a "notice close-action invoked" \
  -s "Actions Test" \
  -b "message body text"
```

Quoting complex commandlines within actions can get tricky, but at least some level of nested quoting is possible
```
notice -t0 -a "simple:xcalc" -a "complex:xterm -bg black -fg white -e bash -c 'echo $PWD ;ls -la ;read -p \"press enter to close\" ;echo bye\! ;sleep 1'" complex action
```
